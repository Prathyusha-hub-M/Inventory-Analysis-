# Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview
This Inventory Analysis in the PowerBI project uses a fictitious dataset from WarmeHands Inc. The dataset presents typical real-world complexities, requiring thorough cleaning and transformation. Power Query and DAX formulas are applied to uncover key insights and provide data-driven recommendations for improved inventory management and purchasing decisions.

## Project Stages
### 1. Data Preparation
- Explores the dataset in Power Query to fix errors and inconsistencies.
- Validate and refine data to ensure accuracy before deeper analysis.

### 2. Inventory Analysis
- Calculate important metrics such as inventory turnover and perform ABC analysis to categorize products.
- Use DAX formulas to identify sales, purchasing, and stock movement trends.

### 3. Reporting and Visualization
- Develop interactive Power BI dashboards to present clear insights on inventory performance.
- Highlight key metrics to guide decisions on purchase strategies and stock levels.
- Explain profitable products, overstock risks, and potential stock-outs.

## Key Results
- Identified and resolved data quality issues, establishing a reliable dataset.
- Created and applied useful metrics for practical inventory management.
- Produced interactive dashboards that showcase overall inventory health and support informed decision-making.
