### 1. Data Preparation
- Explored the dataset in Power Query to fix errors and inconsistencies.
- Validated and refined data to ensure accuracy before deeper analysis.

### 2. Inventory Analysis
- Calculated important metrics such as inventory turnover and performed ABC analysis to categorize products.
- Used DAX formulas to identify sales, purchasing, and stock movement trends.

### 3. Reporting and Visualization
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to present clear insights on inventory performance.
- Highlighted key metrics to guide decisions on purchase strategies and stock levels.
- Explained profitable products, overstock risks, and potential stock-outs.

## Key Results
- Identified and resolved data quality issues, establishing a reliable dataset.
- Created and applied useful metrics for practical inventory management.
