# Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview
**Inventory Management Analysis Using Power BI**

I created an inventory management solution with Power BI. I began by cleaning the dataset using Power Query to fix errors and ensure the data was correct. Then, I calculated key numbers like inventory turnover and used ABC analysis to sort products. I also applied DAX formulas to see trends in sales, purchasing, and stock movement.

I built interactive Power BI dashboards to clearly show my findings. The dashboards highlighted which products were profitable, where there was too much stock, and where shortages might occur. These insights guided decisions on when and what to purchase and helped manage stock more effectively.

## Project Stages
### 1. Data Preparation
- Explored the dataset in Power Query to fix errors and inconsistencies.
- Validated and refined data to ensure accuracy before deeper analysis.

### 2. Inventory Analysis
- Calculated important metrics such as inventory turnover and performed ABC analysis to categorize products.
- Used DAX formulas to identify sales, purchasing, and stock movement trends.

### 3. Reporting and Visualization
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to present clear insights on inventory performance.
- Highlighted key metrics to guide decisions on purchase strategies and stock levels.
- Explained profitable products, overstock risks, and potential stock-outs.

## Key Results
- Identified and resolved data quality issues, establishing a reliable dataset.
- Created and applied useful metrics for practical inventory management.
- Produced interactive dashboards that showcase overall inventory health and support informed decision-making.
